* kubernetes cluster, its state, worker nodes
* kubernetes pods
Controle-Plane struct:
 kube-apiserver (API)
 etcd (Key Value Store) - all configs and current cluster state
 kube-scheduler (SCH) - assigns Pods to Nodes
 kube-controller-manager (CTLM) - runs controllers that control that all is ok in the custer
 
Nodes strcut
 kubelet (KLT) - agent, talks to CP, ensures pods are running and reports their status
 Container Runtime (CR) - soft for mananing containers
 
Pod (smallest deployable uniit) - typically a single instance of a running app. May contain one or more containers with shared network namespace and storage volumes.

Services - an abstraction that defines logical set of pods 
and a policy for how to access them.
